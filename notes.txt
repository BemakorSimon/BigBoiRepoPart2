The compter iteslf:
	Mashines use binary
	Programs must be converted to mahine language 

	Compiler: Converts a program into mahine language and creates a whole new file. Then the computer can use that file.

	An interpreter: It reads the program 1 line at a time, translates it to mashine code, then next line,....
	
	Java uses the combination of the two, It has a compiler - makes it simpler but not quite binary. Then from byte code(simpler) it uses the interpreter to read the program
Hardare 	

	Hardware vs. Software 
	CPU - the thing that runs the programs 
All a proccessor can do 
	read data from main memeory
	adding 2 numbers 
	subtracting 2 numbers
	multiply 2 number
	dividing 2 numbers
	move a piece of data from 1 spot to another
	determine if 1 value is equal to another
Main memory 
	stores a prorgam while it is running 
	stores unsaved data 
	random acess memory 
	called ram because cpu can read it fast
	requires electricty 
secondary storage 
	hard drive 
	disks and stuff
	flash drives 
input output....
Operating system
bininary 
	memory is switches 
	8 bits is 1 byte 
	represent the switches with binary 
Binary conversions 
	Each place value is 2 to a power 
	Try to convert 101101 from binary to a decimal --- 45
	2^5+2^4+2^3+....

parts of java 
	one or more classes
	only one source code class can be public
	public class and flie name must be same
	Each class can be seperated into parts 
Simple prgrame 
	 Class header -- public class Simple
	public static main void (string[] args) -- Main method header
	Java statement -- system.out.print ("cioons") ;
	comment -- //sdfywwiduuf
Every program must have a main method
 main method is where it starts 
Java is case sensitive 

Lesson 2

Variables and Literals
	Variable is storage location in memory 
	literal is value written in the code 
int value; -- Variable declaration statement. It is the data type indentifier (variable "value" That is going to store integers) 
value = 5; -- Must declare variable before using it -- must be right to left

+ as an operator can to 2 thigs 
	it can add two numbers 
	it can add two stings 
cant press enter on strings - will get error 

identifier names : numbers letters underscores and dollarrsigns 
	not allowed to start with a number 
	no spaces
	case sensitive 
	first letter lowercase
Data types
	byte -- integers -- There are different sizes, thats why there are different types.
	float -- floating point (decimals)	
	char -- chartr
	boolean -- True or false 

	short -- integer2
	double -- floating point (decimals) 

	int -- integer3

	long -- integer4

\t -- tab
